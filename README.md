# Object-Oriented Programming in C++

## Project Goal

The objective of this exercise is to implement fundamental OOP paradigms
in C++: abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. The
project demonstrates the creation of a base class, derived classes, and
their usage in code showcasing constructors, destructors, operators, and
virtual methods.

## Technologies Used

-   C++17
-   Class structure following OOP principles
-   Separate header and implementation files
-   Standard libraries: `<iostream>`, `<ostream>`

## Implementation Scope

-   **Wartosc_Liczbowa** -- abstract base class defining the numeric
    interface (module, output).
-   **Liczba** -- real number class; implementation of module, operator
    `+`, and operator `<<`.
-   **Complex** -- complex number class; module computation, addition,
    and formatted output.
-   **main** -- demonstration of polymorphism, object
    construction/destruction, and the difference between overriding and
    overloading.
